#FOR LOOPS
#For loops are used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.

#Syntax:
#for element in sequence:
#    code block

#Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
   print(x)
   if(x == "banana"):
      break
else:
   
   
# for x in range(4):
#     print(x)
