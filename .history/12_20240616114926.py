#2D LISTS
# 2D lists are lists that contain other lists. For example, the following list contains three lists of length 3:

# [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# To access elements in a 2D list, you need two indices. For example, to access the number 6 in the above list, you can use the following code:
# list_name[1][2]

# The first index refers to the outer list, and the second index refers to the inner list. In this case, the number 6 is in the second list (index 1) and the third element (index 2) of that list.
