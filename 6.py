#TUPLES HERE!!!

# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.

# Create a Tuple:
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple","mango","banana",10,20,30)

# Print the first item in the tuple:
# print(mytuple[0])

# Print the last item in the tuple:
# print(mytuple[-1])

# Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:
# print(mytuple[2:5])

# This will raise an error because tuples are unchangeable:
# mytuple[1] = "kiwi"

# print(len(mytuple))
# print(type(mytuple))



print(mytuple)
